# **App Name**: Momentum MVP

## Core Features:

- LLM-Powered Task Ingestion: Takes a natural language text input describing a problem or a list of tasks, and uses a tool to automatically create a basic structured list.
- Task Canvas & Manual Refinement: Displays tasks in a clear, hierarchical list where users can manually edit task titles, add new tasks/sub-tasks, delete tasks/sub-tasks, and reorder tasks/sub-tasks.
- First Step Identification & Focused View: Allows users to define a 'First Step' for a selected task, with the option of a simple LLM-powered suggestion, and includes a 'Focus View' displaying only the selected task and its 'First Step'.
- Basic Progress Tracking & Task Completion: Enables users to mark individual tasks (and sub-tasks) as complete, providing a clear visual distinction for completed tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Clean white or light gray for a minimalist background.
- Secondary color: Dark gray or black for text to ensure readability.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlighting progress.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts for readability.
- Simple, card-based layout for tasks and sub-tasks.
- Use minimalist icons for task actions (edit, delete, add, complete).
